# Transform Games
A tool to represent and analyze games of chance with an emphasis towards slot games.

## Overview

### Representation

A game is a finite sequence of of parameterized-transformations from where the co-domain of any transformation within the sequence is a subset of the domain of the next.  A parameterized-transformation is a function from a set of outcomes to another defined by some parameter.
